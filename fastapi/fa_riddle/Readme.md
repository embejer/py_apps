FastAPI is one of the most popular and fastest framework for back-end development using Python.

FastAPI is on par with Node. This framework does not support front-end files and structures.

This is a basic implementation of FastAPI.

Running the fastapi
    - uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

    **  --main:app main is the module that contains the flask implementation & app is the application.
        --host 0.0.0.0 is the localhost
        --port 8000, you can change it to any port you want.
        --reload, meaning fastapi will restart or reload everything you save any changes.
